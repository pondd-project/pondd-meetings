## Action items
* Amy will send out a CFO to get everyone approved as partial collaborators
* Amy will post some info for Andrea on the SLAC data catalog (see below)

## Notes
* Jetstream - 
    * Click and deploy
    * Jupyter Notebooks
* Build something to transfer data
    * From River to Jetstream
    * Raw datset looking for single pulse - result is small after data reduction
    * Processed data analysis typically applies cuts that reduce data from MB to kB
* Another option: run all services at the same location
* OSN Sites
    * San Diego
    * Johns Hopkins
    * See if we can get allocation on K8s cluster near the OSN node
* DID finder
    * SuperCDMS DataCatalog DID finder inteface to ServiceX (Andrea)
        * Common access pattern examples
    * OSN DID finder (Haythem)
        * CDMS Run 133
        * Don't want all of the files
        * Additional Metadata says which files should not be included
        * R133/good
        * What is the format of the URIs for the files? Are they publicly readable?
            * Could use native S3 with a username/password? Transformer would need to resolve this
            * Single username/password for the dataset
            *
