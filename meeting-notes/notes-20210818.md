## Action items
|what|who|
|----|---|
|Provide name for slack channel | Amy |
|Rename slack channel | Ben |
|Get access to river Kubernetes Cluster | Ben |
|Create initial user stories as GitHub Issues | Ben |
|Prepare single-pulse data challenge for CDMS | Amy|
|Organize thoughts on oct-trees in preparation for Astro challenge | Matt|
|See if IceCube is still considering using Rucio | Amy|

## Notes
- JupyterLab/JupyterHub is a choice - ServiceX does not care about how it is run
- Ben: in my mind Kaitai is limited to codegen/transformer
- Gordon: we did a very simple analysis with scripts and then tried to do the same with ServiceX
- Amy: heck yeah this is an excellent first step!
    - CDMS: plot one pulse from a file
    - CDMS: make a histogram of ptNF with a "no nonsense values" and "no negative energies" cut
    - Matt: a use case in astro -- one common thing is a recursive-descent octree that includes the field values in line.  Right now we have to parse the entire thing to construct indexing systems, but having a higher-level description would enable much more clear identification of the logic to interpret the data and do on-demand reads.  ([A poster](https://samwalkow.github.io/2021-scipy-poster-ScientificWorkflowDescription/) about prototyping an analysis language for yt and volumetric data)

## Decisions
- Setting up Rucio for a collaboration is not within the scope of this grant!
