# About pondd-meetings
This repository contains all PONDD project meeting notes!

# Guidelines
Meeting minutes should be saved in the `meeting-notes` folder in the format `notes-YYYYMMDD.md`.

# How-to
We use hackmd.io to take collaborative notes, and then use the "Versions and GitHub sync" option to push the file to this repository.
